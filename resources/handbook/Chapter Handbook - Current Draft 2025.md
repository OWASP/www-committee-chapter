# Introduction {#introduction}

If you are just starting as a Chapter Leader, THANK YOU so much\! Our mission is enabled by hundreds of active volunteer leaders throughout the world, just like yourself. Again, if you are an existing Chapter Leader, thank you for being a leader in our community. 

## IMPORTANT (some legal stuff) {#important-(some-legal-stuff)}

*The owasp.org website is the only official site of the OWASP Foundation and the entire community it represents. All information is posted and transparent for anyone to see and read on the public website. We provide all leaders an owasp.org email address to use for communicating and representing OWASP. While using an owasp.org email is not enforced, we recommend using it for OWASP and Chapter business.*  

*OWASP has a chapter structure, and the governance is based on Bylaws and the not-for-profit **501(c)(3)** tax-exempt status. While local chapters operate, for the most part, independently from the OWASP Foundation, they are not stand-alone legal entities. Local OWASP Chapters are essentially small local “arms” or “branches” of the OWASP Foundation and must abide by any legal and financial duties or responsibilities imposed on the OWASP Foundation. Furthermore, local chapters and Chapter Leaders are governed by the OWASP Foundation through the Executive Director and the Global OWASP Board.*

*The OWASP Foundation was created and incorporated as a non-profit **501(c)(3)** in the USA but operates globally. Those who might not be familiar with the governing rules and regulations of a **501(c)(3)** organization, should refer to the [Policies and Procedures](https://policy.owasp.org/) page on the OWASP website, which are regularly reviewed and updated.*

*All OWASP local chapters must follow the legal guidelines outlined in [OWASP Word Mark Usage Guidelines](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/mark-usage-guidelines) to protect and preserve all OWASP Foundation trademarks.* 

## Do I have to do all of these? {#do-i-have-to-do-all-of-these?}

Mostly no; some items are mandated by policy, and we are giving tips on how to complete them. Others are just excellent guidance and leading principles maintained by all Chapter Leaders and the Chapters Committee.

## I found a bug in this handbook; how do I get it fixed? {#i-found-a-bug-in-this-handbook;-how-do-i-get-it-fixed?}

If there are disagreements between OWASP bylaws or chapter policy and this handbook, the bylaws and the policy have precedence over this handbook. If you know of improvements or find policy inconsistencies, please help by contacting the OWASP Chapters Committee ([chapter-committee@owasp.org](mailto:chapter-committee@owasp.org)) to update this handbook so it doesn’t become inaccurate or out of date. You can also submit a pull request on GitHub and alert the Chapter Committee to review it and potentially merge your changes. 

# The Purpose of the OWASP Chapter Handbook {#the-purpose-of-the-owasp-chapter-handbook}

The purpose of the OWASP Chapter Handbook is to provide Chapter Leaders with a central place to find information and best practices on organizing a chapter meeting or activity, handling local sponsorships, and many other topics that come up in the course of running a chapter. While there are a few hard and fast rules that Chapter Leaders must follow (rules can be found in various OWASP *the [Policies and Procedures](https://policy.owasp.org/)*, this handbook is primarily composed of suggestions and best practices that have worked well over the years for other successful Chapter Leaders. That said, what works for some chapters may not work for others, and this handbook should not limit the scope of possibilities for running a strong and thriving chapter.

# OWASP Policies vs Handbook {#owasp-policies-vs-handbook}

Please note that HANDBOOKS ARE NOT POLICY. Any policy statements \- outdated or not \- in this handbook that conflicts with current policies, restrictions, or procedures are superseded by the [*Chapters Policy*](https://policy.owasp.org/www-policy/operational/chapters), the [*Expense Policy*](https://policy.owasp.org/www-policy/operational/expense-reimbursement), and all other published policies, such as the temporary COVID restrictions and [*Code of Conduct*](https://policy.owasp.org/www-policy/operational/code-of-conduct) policy. **Published and approved policies always have precedence over the Handbook**.

You can find OWASP Policies here: [https://policy.owasp.org/](https://owasp.org/www-policy/) 

Please familiarize yourselves with these policies as they are the rules that govern OWASP.

# Chapter Leader {#chapter-leader}

Chapter Leaders are volunteers giving their personal time to further the mission of OWASP.  You don't need to be an expert in application security to be a Chapter Leader, just motivated to volunteer to help build a local OWASP community by organizing meetings and other activities to further the mission of OWASP.

Chapter Leaders serve as the main point of contact for their chapters and are responsible for ensuring the chapter complies with all OWASP policies while fulfilling its mission and obligations.

## Leaders as OWASP Members {#leaders-as-owasp-members}

After some time Chapter Leaders can request Complimentary Membership in accordance with the Membership Policy  [https://owasp.org/operational/membership\#complimentary-membership](https://policy.owasp.org/operational/membership#complimentary-membership) 

## Chapter Leader Responsibilities {#chapter-leader-responsibilities}

The main responsibility of the Chapter Leader is to volunteer their time to organize **Free** and Open Meetings (or Activities) for the benefit of the local community while abiding by OWASP principles and code of ethics.

Chapter activities are for the benefit of the local community, and could include, but are not limited to:

* Chapter meeting \- a gathering that can easily be repeatable to discuss a topic or project or listen to someone that has volunteered to speak  
* Student-focused activities, at secondary and/or college level

The activity can be in-person, virtual, or other approved OWASP event run by the OWASP Chapter (or in collaboration with another OWASP chapter or external organization with the approval of the Foundation).

Chapters and Chapter Activities must be discoverable by new and existing members and participants and must be scheduled using an approved OWASP event scheduling system and published on the Chapter’s webpage.

Any chapter events where the attendees are asked to pay for attendance require approval from OWASP, and the financials must be managed by the OWASP Foundation \- see [*Events Policy*](https://policy.owasp.org/www-policy/operational/events).

Member attendance to other organizations’ event does not qualify as chapter activity unless  
the meeting is a joint and co-sponsored event that is promoted to your local chapter community as a chapter events/activity (requires pre-approval of co-marketing from OWASP Foundation)

## Chapter Leader Benefits {#chapter-leader-benefits}

OWASP Foundation recognizes that being a Chapter Leader is a lot of volunteer work.  As thanks for your contribution OWASP offers Leader Benefits, such as:

* Special Discount on attending the OWASP Global AppSec Conferences  
* Complimentary Membership (check [*Membership Policy*](https://policy.owasp.org/operational/membership))  
* Participation in Leaders Meeting at OWASP Global AppSec Conferences  
* Participation in Leaders Mailing List (open to Leaders only)  
* The list of available benefits gets updated periodically please check the [membership porta](https://members.owasp.org)l for membership and leadership benefit details

## OWASP Chapters Legal Status {#owasp-chapters-legal-status}

Chapters are not mini organizations, instead they are akin to branches. While you can develop your chapter to meet the needs of your audience and therefore have great freedom, your chapter is **not an independent legal entity. \***

Chapters cannot sign contracts, hold independent insurance, or hold funds independently of the Foundation. Chapters must abide by the code of conduct, Foundation bylaws, the Core Purpose, Core Values, and the Chapter Policy. If you have more questions, please contact the Chapter Committee ([chapter-committee@owasp.org](mailto:chapter-committee@owasp.org)). 

*\*In case your country's local laws require a legal entity for running the Chapter \- please contact the OWASP Foundation Executive Director.*

# 

# Starting an OWASP Chapter {#starting-an-owasp-chapter}

Please see “[Handbook: Apply for a Chapter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BOAoY6cZ6abxxMRxzmG6824sJWw10oEDtwOE4gCC4qc/edit?usp=sharing)”

# Running Your Chapter {#running-your-chapter}

## Your Audience {#your-audience}

Who should attend?

* *Local application security / infosec professionals* \- reach out to app sec pros working for local companies in your area or as independent contractors/consultants. They can give talks, offer venue/food support, and bring in new members.  
* *Students* \- if there are colleges/universities nearby, invite computer science/infosec students to attend.   
* *Developers* \- connect with local software developer meetups and invite them to your Chapter’s OWASP meetups. Many developers may be interested in learning about security.  
* *Vendors* \- security vendors can sponsor events or give talks, but be wary of allowing them to promote their products (OWASP has “no sales pitches” policy for talks).  
* *Guest speakers* \- invite guest speakers from your community or from outside. OWASP Chapter Committee maintains a Speakers Bureau; a list of speakers you can ask to present at your Chapter (in-person or online).

The key is to get a diverse group of engaged, active attendees together to help grow your chapter. Keep the focus on application security as much as possible and adopt a light-pressure on selling/recruiting for OWASP. OWASP meetings should benefit the community.

## Your Hosting Location {#your-hosting-location}

A good location is one that fits the size of the audience and is one that many folks can attend easily, such as near a public transport hub, or an easy drive with available parking. **A stable and consistent location can help chapter growth as people know where to go.**

Many companies are interested in hosting events such as OWASP Chapter meetings. As a leader, there are several advantages to being hosted by a company, especially in terms of ease of organization compared to venues such as restaurants. Make sure that the meeting is still vendor independent. Of course, if a company is hosting the meeting, and perhaps providing food and drink, they could be given an opportunity to promote themselves.

Be mindful of temporary or additional restrictions on physical (in-person) activities that change regularly depending on current events (e.g. [COVID Restrictions](https://owasp.org/blog/2022/07/28/covid-restrictions)) or location.

## Picking a Day {#picking-a-day}

A good way to build up attendance is to have a regular day for meetings (e.g. 4th Wed of every month).  You can still hold an in-person meeting to foster community and networking \- like facilitating a discussion panel or social event. There’s always the option to meet virtually as well.

## Setting up Chapter Social Media Accounts {#setting-up-chapter-social-media-accounts}

We encourage the chapter to set up social media accounts to promote the chapter within various social networks and gather more engagement from the local community. OWASP does not provide special social media accounts so set up a regular account, however please attempt to use “@owasp-chaptername” (e.g., owasp-london, owasp-losangeles, etc.) so the public can easily find the chapter. Please link any social media accounts to the chapter home page.   
Social media accounts belong to the Chapter and not to individuals. As leaders, you are the custodians of these accounts and you must share the access with your co-leaders and if you resign, transfer the social media accounts to new leadership. 

## Finding Chapter Supporters/Sponsors {#finding-chapter-supporters/sponsors}

We strongly encourage the chapter to obtain local chapter supporters (Chapter Meeting Sponsors) to offset or pay for local chapter expenses, such as venue, food and beverages, and more. This is often called bartering, and many chapters have such arrangements. Sponsors who wish to use their donated space and related expenses as a tax deduction should contact OWASP Foundation directly for any needed documentation. 

Local chapter supporters can be permitted to have logos in the monthly chapter slide decks or on the chapter home page.  They may have marketing banners or tables present. Any bartering (exchange of goods/location/etc.) chapter arrangements must follow the Bartering section of the [*Expense Policy*](https://policy.owasp.org/www-policy/operational/expense-reimbursement).

Chapter supporters must comply with OWASP [*Privacy Policy*](https://policy.owasp.org/operational/privacy) requirements, abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/code-of-conduct), and support our mission and [Core Values](https://owasp.org/about/). Please encourage chapter supporters to apply for [Corporate Sponsorships or Support](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7/group/18/create/72).

## Shared Services from OWASP Foundation {#shared-services-from-owasp-foundation}

### Mailing List (Google Group) {#mailing-list-(google-group)}

An option for communicating with the public and chapter members is to utilize Google Groups.  As a Chapter Leader, you can use your chapter's Google Group to send announcements, plan events, and hold discussions. 

#### Joining Your Chapter's Google Group {#joining-your-chapter's-google-group}

The OWASP Foundation will provide a Google Groups for the chapter.  As a Chapter Leader using your owasp.org email account, manage the Google Group for your chapter.

#### Sending Messages {#sending-messages}

Once joined, a Chapter Leader can send emails to the entire group by emailing the group's address, such as \[chapter-name\]-chapter@owasp.org.

#### Managing Group Settings {#managing-group-settings}

As a Chapter Leader, you may have permission to manage settings for your Google Group.  See the ‘Global Settings’ for the group for available options.  Typically, many Chapter Leaders only use the Google Group as an announcement method for Chapter information.  Rarely do Chapters allow members to directly post to the Group.

#### Approving Join Requests {#approving-join-requests}

A group administrator must adjudicate all requests to join the Google Group.  Depending on the group settings, approving a member joining request will allow the email address to receive any new messages and see the legacy message posted.  The member will be able to change their own settings to a weekly digest as needed.

Make sure to periodically check for any new join requests so you can approve/deny members in a timely manner.

#### Promoting Your Google Group {#promoting-your-google-group}

A link to the Google Group should be included on the Chapter page within the owasp.org website.

### Slack Channel  {#slack-channel}

Within the OWASP Foundation managed Slack workspace, a channel is created for the chapter (example \#chapter-losangeles).  Chapter Leaders should join the channel and respond timely and appropriately as members join and create messages.  A link to the Slack Channel should be included on the Chapter page within the owasp.org website.

### OWASP Gear {#owasp-gear}

#### Tablecloth, Banners, Flyers, Stickers T-Shirts etc  {#tablecloth,-banners,-flyers,-stickers-t-shirts-etc}

The OWASP Foundation can provide an OWASP-branded tablecloth and other merchandise upon request.  In order to request the tablecloth and other merchandise you will need to raise a ticket at [Non-funding request-\>Contact-\>Request Merchandise](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7)

### OWASP Merchandise Store {#owasp-merchandise-store}

OWASP has an online merchandise store: [https://owasp.org/store](https://owasp.org/store) where you can purchase a range of t-shirts, hoodies, stickers, mugs, masks, and more. Each purchase you make helps fund the OWASP mission.

The OWASP Foundation store is strictly for fundraising purposes. **There will be no reimbursements from OWASP for any purchases.** Please use the ‘Request Merchandise’ Jira ticket to request free merchandise from the OWASP Foundation for the Chapter.

# Planning a Chapter Meeting or Activity {#planning-a-chapter-meeting-or-activity}

OWASP Local Chapters build communities for application security professionals around the world. Local Chapter Meetings are FREE and OPEN to anyone to attend so both members and non-members are always welcome.

## Meeting format {#meeting-format}

Chapter Leaders are encouraged to try various formats to determine the most successful ones for their audience and area. Also, it may work best to have a variety of meeting formats throughout the year, depending on the speaker and meeting space availability. Meetings should target in-person primarily but virtual is an option.  Having both is the best for any potential attendees.

Examples of potential Chapter meeting formats:

* Seminar with one speaker (1 hour talk)   
* Seminar with two speakers (2 x 45 minute talks with Q\&A session).  Optional 10-15 minute break in between the talks for in-person events  
* Seminar with lightning talks (3-6 x 10-minute talks)  
* Capture The Flag (CTF) or Secure Coding Tournament  
* Social meeting with intro talk only  
* Social meeting with vendors presenting 2-minute pitches  
* All-day event (aka AppSec Day) \- this needs OWASP Foundation approval \- please refer to the Chapter and Events Policy

If you are planning to have a Chapter Meeting during the working week, it is best to schedule it to start after 6pm to give an opportunity for attendees to commute from work or schedule the event at lunch time (“lunch & learn”).

Please check out the Chapter Committee page, Slack or come to a Chapter Committee meeting and ask for advice if further clarification or assistance is needed. 

## Obtaining Speakers {#obtaining-speakers}

We recommend local speakers first and foremost and help up-and-coming talent practice their public speaking skills. Local speakers (and new individuals) are how to generate more application security professionals and promote more of the OWASP mission. 

The OWASP Chapter Committee maintains [a Speakers Bureau](https://github.com/OWASP/www-committee-chapter/tree/master/resources/speakers), which is a list of speakers who are available to speak at Chapter meetings, virtually or in-person.  **Rarely** will the OWASP Foundation reimburse travel expenses for a speaker, please review the [*Expense Policy*](https://policy.owasp.org/www-policy/operational/expense-reimbursement) and submit a pre-approval request before the travel.

### Speaker Agreement & Slides {#speaker-agreement-&-slides}

OWASP is a vendor-neutral community and we want to avoid any commercialism, i.e., ”sales pitches” or “product promotions” in speaker presentations. All speakers must be made aware of the OWASP vendor neutrality stance, Core Values, the Code of Conduct and the OWASP Speaker Agreement. You should share the link to the  [Keynote, Speaker, and Trainer Agreement](https://policy.owasp.org/legal/speaker-agreement) with prospective speakers before agreeing to the event. 

Encourage speakers to use the standard OWASP presentation template which can be found at OWASP website \> Policies and Procedures \> [Branding Guidelines](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/branding)

…or a blank/unbranded template 

## Food and Beverage {#food-and-beverage}

OWASP permits chapters to serve food and beverages at physical events if the event location allows food. If you decide to offer food and drinks, we strongly urge you to find local chapter supporters to help or completely cover food and beverage expenses. It is also possible for meeting attendees to split the cost if they want food at the meeting or pay their own meal costs; however, no one can be excluded from a meeting based on their ability or willingness to pay for food. Chapter meetings must remain **free and open to everyone**.

If you choose to have alcohol at meetings, we encourage you to follow safe service and consumption of alcohol laws, regulations, or guidelines in your country. Please review the [Expenses Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/expense-reimbursement) before claiming reimbursement for alcohol, as there are limitations.

## Promoting your meeting or activity {#promoting-your-meeting-or-activity}

Please make sure you get the word out early and often about the upcoming chapter meetings or activities by posting upcoming events to Meetup or the chapter’s scheduling platform, the chapter’s home page, on the chapter social media platform(s), and the OWASP community Slack channel of the chapter. 

Don’t forget to include the OWASP Logo to promote your Chapter Meeting/Activity, but please check the [Branding Guidelines](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/branding.html) to ensure the most recent version of the OWASP official and approved branding is used.

Other than monthly chapter meetings, chapters that wish to run virtual, local, or regional activities or events must follow the [Events Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/events.html), even if it’s virtual or free. This means applying for an approval for the event first. Reviewing and approving an event by the OWASP Foundation will ensure the event doesn’t overlap with other events. The OWASP Foundation can help you gain sponsors, obtain insurance, help run registration, provide video conferencing or webinar facilities, and promote your activities or events on OWASP’s social media. The earlier you can submit your event, the more support and promotion you’ll get from the OWASP Foundation and the community. 

## Entry for all  {#entry-for-all}

Ensure that your meeting/activity location is accessible for participants.  OWASP is open, vendor-neutral, and transparent. Entry must be equal to all: Chapter Leaders cannot deny entrance under normal circumstances.

If the meeting location has building security, please ensure you document the entry requirements in the RSVP section of the meeting announcement. 

Give meeting attendees time to enter and sign in, such as holding an informal networking/social event before the official open.

All attendees are bound by the [OWASP Code of Conduct](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/code-of-conduct) at the meeting or activity.  Chapter Leaders should be familiar with the policy and follow the guidelines if there is concern for physical safety or violence.

## Sharing Attendee Information {#sharing-attendee-information}

Providing the hosting organization or supporters of the meeting a list of people registering for or attending the Chapter meeting is **prohibited**. This might even be illegal in certain countries due to privacy laws. The supporter can collect leads themselves, for example, by offering a prize for those who volunteer their contact details.  If the hosting organization requires attendee information for access, prior to finalizing the location agreement (informal or otherwise) the hosting organization must be made aware that any of the provided information is only to be used for facilities security purposes, not for marketing purposes.

## Registration and Tickets {#registration-and-tickets}

Use the OWASP Event Scheduling Platform (currently Meetup.com)

# Running your Chapter Meeting {#running-your-chapter-meeting}

Much extended information is available in the [How to run a Chapter Meeting](https://policy.owasp.org/operational/chapters#:~:text=dispute%20resolution%20process.-,Running%20a%20Chapter,-Discoverability). 

## Name Badges for Attendees {#name-badges-for-attendees}

Since many people are first time or occasional attendees, name badges for attendees are recommended.

## Meeting slides {#meeting-slides}

The format and content of a slide deck for a chapter meeting is primarily at the discretion of the Chapter Leader.  Suggested  slides for OWASP activities are made available in the Chapter Committee’s [Resources For Chapters](https://owasp.org/www-committee-chapter/#div-resources_for_chapters) section, which includes upcoming events, offers or additional membership benefits, news, and more. Customize the overall slide deck to include the local supporters, local events and activities (not just OWASP), and any local recognition (volunteers, jobs, etc.).

## Membership Promotion {#membership-promotion}

Encourage non-members to join OWASP at every chapter meeting.  Individual membership discounts are available for some regions and for active students.

## Live-Streaming Recording and uploading videos  {#live-streaming-recording-and-uploading-videos}

In many countries, consent must be given in order to record a session. Please check OWASP’s [Privacy Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/privacy.html). The chapter is encouraged to establish that default expectation of recording and live streaming the events is standard practice for the chapter. This will help share knowledge and the OWASP mission far and wide. You should promote these recordings or live streams on your social media once uploaded. 

## CPE and Certificates of Attendance {#cpe-and-certificates-of-attendance}

Many attendees want CPE (continuing professional education) credits. A chapter is under no obligation to provide CPE certificates of attendance. If providing CPE certificates, a record of attendance must be kept for an amount of time (example 2 years) for reference/audit purposes.  CPE credits should only be provided to attendees.  CPE certificate design is not standard and reliant on the chapter to create their own.

## Continuous Improvement \- Surveys {#continuous-improvement---surveys}

Surveys can be provided to the attendees, sponsors, speakers, etc. of a Chapter meeting in order to discover improvements.  OWASP Foundation has no survey shared service to leverage.

# Chapter Leadership Governance {#chapter-leadership-governance}

## Leadership Titles Used Locally {#leadership-titles-used-locally}

As specified in the [Chapter Policy Rules of Procedure](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/chapters), the OWASP Foundation recognizes up to five leaders, regardless of title. You can use nearly any terms you like locally that you feel will help the public work out what you do for the chapter. You can use local terminology, or you can use no titles at all. It’s up to you. 

Please avoid confusion with the OWASP Global Board of Directors by avoiding the terms “Chair,” “Vice-Chair,” “Secretary,” “Treasurer,” “Executive Director,” and “Director,” as these have specific legal meaning for a US-based non-profit organization. If you have historically had or want these titles, please place “Chapter” in front of the title to reduce confusion.

## Responding to your members and the OWASP Foundation {#responding-to-your-members-and-the-owasp-foundation}

Please try to respond promptly to any messages from members, OWASP Foundation, or other supporters. If you don’t want to manage yet another email address, forward your owasp.org email to an email address that you monitor regularly.

Use the owasp.org email address for all correspondence relating to the Chapter and OWASP.   Please set your owasp.org email address on the Chapter page for all inquiries.

## Leadership Rotation and Elections {#leadership-rotation-and-elections}

The OWASP Foundation encourages the leadership for Chapters to be refreshed periodically to infuse new ideas and energy into the chapter and enhance the pool of volunteers for leading the chapter. The [Chapter Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/chapters) recommends holding elections every 2-3 years or appointing new leadership. While it is encouraged, leadership rotations are up to each chapter to determine.

Occasional polling during a Chapter meeting to determine if leadership rotation is needed is encouraged.  The OWASP Foundation can assist in holding an election on behalf of the Chapter, overseen by the Chapter Committee.   If OWASP Foundation assistance is needed, please log an [assistance request ticket](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/8/group/20/create/88) for an election. 

## Transferring Leadership {#transferring-leadership}

Whether by election or organic leadership transitions, please submit a [Chapter Support ticket](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/8) to change leaders. The *leaders.md* file on the Chapter’s webpage should also reflect the names and emails of the approved Chapter Leaders. 

# **Chapter Expenses**  {#chapter-expenses}

Chapter expenses must comply with the [Expense Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/expense-reimbursement.html).  Chapters have no direct individual budgets for expenses and must request all reimbursements from the OWASP Foundation.  Only expenses compliant with the [Expense Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/expense-reimbursement) and submitted within the specified time period will be paid. 

## Fundraising and Membership Drives {#fundraising-and-membership-drives}

Chapters are encouraged to fundraise for OWASP Foundation through donations, individual or student memberships, bartering arrangements, and corporate sponsorships.   As stated in the [Donations Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/donations), donations must come through the [Donate](https://owasp.org/donate/) form for tax and compliance reasons.

## Handling Money {#handling-money}

### Expenses {#expenses}

Chapter Leaders might incur expenses that may be reimbursable by the OWASP Foundation.  
Please check the latest [Expense Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/expense-reimbursement) for more information on what expenses are reimbursable and on how to request reimbursement.

### Expense Reimbursement Process {#expense-reimbursement-process}

Expense reimbursement requests, along with receipts or invoices for each expense, shall be submitted through the OWASP Foundation ticketing system for processing and payment, as detailed in the [Expense Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/expense-reimbursement).

## Contract with Third Parties {#contract-with-third-parties}

Chapters are not independent legal entities and as such leaders cannot donate OWASP funds to other organizations, hold independent funds (such as a personal bank account or local PayPal), process memberships or sponsorships, sign contracts, or enter into agreements. 

If you need a contract or agreement to be reviewed and signed or register a bartering arrangement, please submit through the OWASP Foundation ticketing system a request for assistance.

If the Chapter requires funding above the Expense threshold as listed in the [Expense Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/expense-reimbursement) for reimbursements, the Chapter should apply for a Grant \- please consult the [Grants Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/grants) for more information on the Grants process.
